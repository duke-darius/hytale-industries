I got bored of opening the .log file in on my PC everytime I wanted to view my other mods log outputs so I built this.

You can filter by Logger Name, Log Level and log text!


To see the console type \`/console\` in game![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/description/null/description_db0b0a8e-88c0-4d01-9b40-bdcebaddc100.png)
 

I really wanted to bind the opening to '~' but I cant find any way to do that yet, if you do see it, let me know!
